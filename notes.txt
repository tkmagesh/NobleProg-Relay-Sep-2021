    2. Mutation (update the data)


Server Side
    Types
    Queries 
        Resolvers
            Collects the data from the data source (database, REST api)
    Mutations
    

    Types example : Bug, Project, User, Comments
    Query example : getBugs, getProjects, getUser, totalBugs


    Master Data
        Remains unchanged
        Read Optimized

    Analytical Data

    Append Only (with very minimal updates)
        Read Optimized

    Transactional Data
        Write Optimized

    Relay
        Store
        Colocation (data + presentation)
        relay compiler
        relay runtime

    

Setup application for Relay
    1. Create a new project
        yarn create react-app <app-name>

    2. Install the dependencies
        runtime dependencies
            yarn add react-relay relay-runtime

        dev dependencies
            yarn add --dev relay-compiler graphql babel-plugin-relay

        tools
            yarn add global get-graphql-schema

    3. get the schema from the server
        get-graphql-schema <url> > schema.graphql

    4. configure the compilter
        "scripts" : {
            ...
            "relay" : "yarn run relay-compiler --schema schema.graphl --src ./src/"
        }

    5. configure 'fetch' to be used by relay

    6. Create the environment
